and [Thomas J. Sargent](https://files.nyu.edu/ts43/public/).

The course consists of

1. A [series of lectures](http://quant-econ.net)
1. A [code repository](https://github.com/jstac/quant-econ) containing Python
   programs described in the lectures

   ### Getting Started

   We recommend you start by visiting the [lecture series main
   page](http://quant-econ.net), which provides detailed information on
   getting
   starting with Python and working with [the code
   repository](https://github.com/jstac/quant-econ).  

   #### About Git

   This page is a front end to the code repository, which is stored on
   [Github](http://github.com). The primary function of Github is to host open
   source code repositories in a manner that facilitates sharing and
   collaboration.  Note that you can always download a copy of the repository 
   by clicking the '.zip' (or '.tar.gz') button above.  However it's advisable
   that
   you read the [lecture series](http://quant-econ.net) first, where all the
   programs are explained.

   If you decide to learn a bit more about Git and Github, you'll
   find it's an excellent investment. A good place to start is the [Github
   help
   page](https://help.github.com/).
